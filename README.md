Mental health is one of the most important aspects of a researcherâ€™s life. Post-graduate students face numerous challenges that impact their mental well-being, including stress, anxiety, imposter syndrome, depression, self-loathing, panic, burnout and isolation. Despite the increased efforts to create awareness of mental health issues and interventions, mental health stigma still weighs heavily among post-graduate students. Additionally, mental health literacy is not common knowledge. This project aims to bridge the gap in mental health among postgraduate students by creating awareness, building peer networks and developing international programs.
